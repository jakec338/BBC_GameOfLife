Conway's Game of Life for the BBC

Conway's Game of Life for BBC Graduate Software Scheme

Logic written in Javascript

This version of the Game of Life deals with the infinite nature of the problem by mirroring the boundaries of all sides
the sqaure in which the game is played

This is not ideal as cells are altered from what they should be occasionally, however, if played on a sufficiently large grid
the effect on the scenario should be negligible. 

Enjoy!
